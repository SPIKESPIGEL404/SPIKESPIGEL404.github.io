## Start simple

The best architecture is the one you don't build yet. A monolith that works is better than a distributed system that doesn't. You can always extract services later when you actually need them.

## Design for failure

Every external dependency will fail. Every network call will timeout. Every disk will fill up. Design your system assuming these failures happen regularly, because they do.

## Key principles

- **Idempotency**: Make operations safe to retry. This simplifies error recovery enormously.
- **Backpressure**: If a component is overwhelmed, it should push back rather than silently dropping work.
- **Observability**: If you can't see what's happening, you can't fix it. Structured logging, metrics, and tracing are not optional.

## The database is your bottleneck

Until proven otherwise, assume the database is the bottleneck. Optimize queries, add appropriate indexes, and consider read replicas before reaching for caching layers.

## Caching

Cache invalidation is one of the two hard problems in computer science. Before adding a cache, make sure you understand your invalidation strategy and can tolerate stale data.
