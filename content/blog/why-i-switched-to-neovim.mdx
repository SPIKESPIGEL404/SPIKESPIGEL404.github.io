## The motivation

VS Code is a great editor. But after years of use, I started feeling the overhead — Electron memory usage, extension conflicts, slow startup. I wanted something faster and more keyboard-driven.

## The transition

The learning curve is real. I spent the first two weeks being significantly slower. But I committed to using Neovim for everything and gradually built muscle memory.

## What I gained

- **Speed**: Neovim starts in milliseconds. Editing feels instant.
- **Composability**: Vim motions compose. Once you learn the grammar (verb + noun), you can express complex edits concisely.
- **Focus**: No sidebar, no status bar clutter, no notifications. Just code.
- **Portability**: My config is a git repo. SSH into any server and I have my full editor.

## My setup

I keep my config minimal:

- `lazy.nvim` for plugin management
- `telescope` for fuzzy finding
- `treesitter` for syntax highlighting
- `lspconfig` for language servers
- A custom colorscheme with minimal colors

## Would I recommend it?

Only if you enjoy tinkering and want a deeper relationship with your tools. VS Code is objectively more productive out of the box. Neovim is an investment that pays off over years.
